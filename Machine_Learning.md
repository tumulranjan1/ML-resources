# Machine Learning for Beginners
In this post, I'm going to discuss a complete roadmap and the resources for people who are new to machine learning

## Intoduction to Machine Learning
In its simplest terms, machine learning involves teaching a machine to predict or make decisions based on data, as opposed to relying solely on predefined instructions provided by a programmer.

Unlike traditional programming, which relies on explicit rules set by a programmer to address a problem, machine learning employs algorithms to discover patterns and connections within data.

## Roadmap
### 1. Learn Mathematics Required
+ Linear Algebra (Matrix , Vectors)
+ Statistics
+ Probability
+ Calculus

### 2. Learn Python and its libraries
+ Python
+ Numpy
+ Pandas

### 3. Learn ML Algorithms
+ Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning
+ Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Clustering
+ KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)
+ SVM (Support Vector Machines)
+ Decision trees
+ Gradient Descent, Slope
+ Radom Forests and other ML algorithms

### 4. Learn ML Libraries
+ Scikit Learn
+ TensorFlow
+ PyTorch

## Step 1 : Learning Mathematics Required for Machine Learning
To learn mathematics for machine learning you can refer to a book named [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf)

else if you want to learn from videos, you can refer to:

for Linear Algebra : [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=Izr81KxLSuLRNms1)

for Calculus : [Essence of Calculus](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&si=5Sgtw_18ulyYzD24)

## Step 2 : Learning Python Programming Fundamentals

==> if you are a complete beginner to python programming, you can refer to any one of the videos below

1. By FreeCodeCamp.org - [Python for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc)

2. By CodeWithHarry (in Hindi) - [Python Tutorial For Beginners In Hindi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfDE2a7MKjA&t=19s)

## Step 2.1 (Optional) - Learning Data Analysis Libraries in Python

for this you can refer to this amazing video by FreeCodeCamp.org on their YouTube channel :

[Data Analysis with Python Course - Numpy, Pandas, Data Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPVsHOlRBBI)

# Step 3 : Learning Machine Learning Concepts

If you are a total beginner, you might wanna get an overview of the core ML concepts. Here are some resources that might help you out for this (You can choose any one of these) :

1. Course by FreeCodeCamp.org - [Machine Learning for Everybody](https://youtu.be/i_LwzRVP7bg?si=rlgBUdWZndb7w5q6)

2. Course by Tech with Tim - [Python Machine Learning & AI Mega Course - Learn 4 Different Areas of ML & AI](https://youtu.be/WFr2WgN9_xE?si=fMZF-MNN7wvu1vVc)

After you get a hang of what machine learning is and its concepts following any one of these courses, you can refer to this amazing course by google which teaches you the fundamentals of machine learning with Tensorflow
